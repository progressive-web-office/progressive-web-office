# Settings

**⚙** in the header (or *settings* in the command palette,
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) opens the settings window. The
settings are grouped by category; every change is kept in this browser at
once.

## General

- **Language** of the interface (English, French, Chinese).
- **Theme**: as the system, light or dark.
- **Your name**: it signs your comments, PDF annotations and tracked
  changes, and shows you to the other participants of a collaboration (and
  of a synchronisation without a network). Without one, it is asked once,
  the first time it is needed; renaming yourself in a collaboration changes
  it too.
- **New files in**: OpenDocument (open standard) or Microsoft Office
  formats, for new documents and the format offered first when saving.

## Reading and review

How PDF files and text documents in [review mode](./review) are shown when
they open:

- **Pages side by side**: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6;
- **Zoom**: fit the width or the whole page;
- **Page layout**: scrolling, or page by page without scrolling;
- **Remember the last choice made in the toolbar**: when it is on, a change
  in the toolbar becomes the default for the next file; turn it off to open
  every file with the settings above;
- **Review mode for every file**: PDF files and text documents open in
  [review mode](./review), until it is left (*Edit*) in any of them — the
  same switch as the *Review mode* button of the documents and PDF files.

For example, to read two whole pages side by side, page by page: 2 pages,
*Whole page*, *Page by page*.

## Writing

- **Typography as you type**: curly quotes, dashes, ellipsis and French
  no-break spaces (for the documents opened next).
- **When a code cell runs**: what happens to the cells using it —
  marked as out of date (the default), run too, or nothing (the classic
  notebook, cells run in the order of the document). See
  [reactive cells](./code#reactive-cells).

## Collaboration

How the participants of a [real-time collaboration](./collaboration) find
each other and connect: **relays** (Nostr, one `wss://` address per line;
empty: a list of well-known public relays, all used at once) and a **TURN server** with its user name and password,
for networks that block direct connections between browsers. They are used by
the next sessions. The password is kept in this browser like the other
settings.

## Printing

The defaults of the print preview: paper, orientation and margins.

The settings stay in this browser: they are not sent anywhere, and another
browser or device has its own.
