# ZIP archives, source files and pictures

## Opening a ZIP archive

Open a `.zip` file like any document (**Open**, drag and drop, or the file
handler of the installed app). When the archive is not itself a document,
it opens as a folder in the side panel, with its sub-folders and files:

- text documents, spreadsheets, presentations and PDF files open in their
  editors;
- text and source files (C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, R, MATLAB, SQL and
  many more) open in the code editor described below;
- pictures (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, AVIF) are shown;
- any other file can be downloaded.

An archive inside the archive (🗜️) is a folder too: click it to see its
files. Archives can be nested several levels deep.

Files are decompressed only when you open them, so large archives (up to
1 GB) open quickly. Junk entries added by some systems (`__MACOSX`,
`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) are left out, and paths that would leave the
archive are ignored.

The search field of the panel also searches the text and source files.

### Changing the archive

Save, create, rename, move or delete files as in any folder: the changes
are kept in the archive in memory, including inside nested archives. To keep
them, click **⬇** next to the archive's name: it downloads the archive with
its changes. Closing a changed archive without downloading it asks for
confirmation.

### Archives that are documents

Some ZIP files are documents and open as such: OpenDocument and Office
files, MDZ files, a LaTeX project (one main `.tex` file with its pictures and
bibliography, see [LaTeX](./latex.md)) and a ZIP of Markdown notes with their
pictures. A ZIP holding several LaTeX projects, or LaTeX and Markdown files
next to office documents or source code, opens as a folder.

## Text and source files

A text or source file opens in a code editor with line numbers, syntax
colouring for its language, folding, bracket matching and search
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>). The toolbar shows the language, the encoding
and the line ends, and offers:

- **Wrap long lines**;
- **↧ Go to line** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>).

<kbd>Tab</kbd> indents the line. To leave the editor with the keyboard, press
<kbd>Esc</kbd> then <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

**Save** keeps the file's name and extension. Files are read as UTF-8 or,
when they are not valid UTF-8, as Windows-1252; they are saved in UTF-8,
keeping their byte order mark and their line ends (LF or CRLF).

Printing a source file prints its text with line numbers and colours.

### Review comments

**💬 Comment the line** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>) asks
for a comment and writes it above the line of the cursor, as a comment of
the file's language, with your name:

```python
    # REVIEW(Prof): Use sum(xs)
    for x in xs:
```

```c
  // REVIEW(Prof): Check argc first
```

The comments stay in the file, so any editor shows them. They are
highlighted and listed in the **Review comments** panel: **Show** goes to the
line, **Delete** removes the comment. Combined with a ZIP archive, this
lets you comment the files of an archive and download it with the
comments.

Python, JavaScript and TypeScript files (and the other languages that know
their keywords) are completed as you type: keywords, snippets, the names of
the file, and for JavaScript and TypeScript the standard objects and their
members. It is not a full type checker: TypeScript is completed like
JavaScript, without its types.

## Pictures

A picture is shown fitted to the window; **Actual size** shows it at its own
size. The status bar gives its dimensions. SVG pictures are shown as images:
their scripts never run.
