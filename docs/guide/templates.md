# Templates and examples

**Templates and examples** (🧩 on the start screen) opens a gallery. The
document you pick opens as a new, untitled document in your preferred format
(OpenDocument or Microsoft Office, chosen on the start screen): save it
where you want. The templates are written in the language of the interface
(English for languages without a translation of their content).

![The gallery of templates: a tab per kind, each with its emoji, and a card with its emoji per template](/screenshots/templates.png)

The gallery shows **one kind at a time**: the tabs at the top — *Text
documents*, *Spreadsheets*, *Presentations*, *Drawings and pictures*,
*Examples*, and *My templates* or the templates of the open folder when
there are some (they come first) — choose which; the arrow keys move from
tab to tab. **Search a template or an example…** looks through all of them
by name and description.

## Text documents

| Template | What it has |
| --- | --- |
| Letter | Laid out as usual in its language, each line of an address on its own line, blocks separated by space. In French: sender on the left; recipient, place and date ("Paris, le …") and signature from 9 cm; subject and enclosures; indented, justified paragraphs. In English: block style, everything on the left |
| Report | Title page without header and footer, table of contents, page numbers, a captioned table referenced from the text |
| Meeting minutes | Attendees, agenda, discussion, a table of actions |
| Exercise sheet | Numbered exercises with equations, a name field in the header |
| Scientific article | A4 with 2.5 cm margins, title, authors and affiliations, abstract, keywords, introduction, methods with a numbered equation, results with a captioned table, discussion, conclusion, acknowledgements, citations and the list of references |
| Newspaper | A school newspaper or newsletter on A4 with 15 mm margins: masthead with the issue and the date, an article in three columns with a rule between them and a column break, news in brief, an agenda, an interview in two columns (see [Columns](./documents.md#columns)) |

## Spreadsheets

| Template | What it has |
| --- | --- |
| Budget | Income and expenses by month, totals, balance, a column chart, frozen headings |
| Grade book | Marks, rounded averages, results computed with `IF`, class average, `COUNTIF` |
| Invoice | Items, quantities, unit prices, subtotal, VAT and total, date of the day |

## Presentations

**Talk**: a title slide, an outline, content slides with bullets and speaker
notes.

**Race signs**: start, arrows (right, left, straight on), kilometre marks,
water station and finish, each on an A4 landscape page, in letters several
centimetres high and high-contrast colours. Print one slide per page and
laminate them. Turn them to portrait with the orientation list; the text
sizes follow.

## Drawings and pictures

Drawings open as pictures, ready for **✏️ Edit the drawing** (see
[Drawings and schematics](./drawing.md)), saved as `.svg`:

- **Electrical circuit**: an RC circuit, a battery charging a capacitor
  through a resistor, the wires attached to the pins;
- **Ladder diagram (LD)**: start / stop with a holding contact, in the
  ladder language of IEC 61131-3;
- **Grafcet (SFC)**: a two-step cycle with its transitions and an action;
- **Pneumatic circuit**: a double-acting cylinder driven by a 5/2 valve
  (ISO 1219);
- **Flowchart**: a decision with two branches (ISO 5807).

Pictures, made by the application itself and free to use (CC0), open ready
for **🎨 Paint on the picture**, saved as `.png`: **Graph paper** (a 5 mm
grid on an A4 page), **Colour wheel**, **Pixel art** (a 32 × 32 canvas).

## Examples

**A tour of the word processor** shows what a text document can hold:
formatting, footnotes, a table of contents, an equation numbered and
referenced, a captioned table, a Mermaid diagram, a Python code cell and
citations with their list of references. Change anything to try it.

**Lab report with Python plots** mixes text, equations and Python cells
(numpy, matplotlib, SymPy): a least-squares fit with error bars, damped
oscillations, a Bode plot, a histogram of repeated measurements, a field map
and a differential equation solved symbolically. The output and figures are
already there when it opens; **⏩** runs every cell again in the browser.

**Interactive widgets** shows [widgets](./code.md#widgets) in cells: a
slider written in Python with anywidget, made reactive with `pwo.ui`, drives
a plot that is drawn again when the slider moves; a button written in a
JavaScript cell counts clicks with a cell that follows it. Press **⏩**, then
play with them. It also tells how to use the anywidget instruments.

**Instrument panel** uses the
[anywidget instruments](https://anywidgetinstruments.github.io/): its first
cell installs them from the wheels published with their demos (you are asked
first, then they are kept for offline use); two knobs and a switch, made
reactive with `pwo.ui`, drive a tank, a gauge, a thermometer, a LED and a
seven-segment display, as in their marimo gallery.

**Languages** holds one small program in each language the cells run:
statistics in Python, Fibonacci numbers in JavaScript, a word count in Lua,
a table created then queried in SQL, a sieve of Eratosthenes in C, a sorted
ranking in C++, and a linear fit with its plot in R. Press **⏩**: each
runtime is downloaded the first time, after you agree (see
[Other languages](./code.md#other-languages-lua-sql-c-c-r)).

**Measurements and charts** is a workbook: a damped signal computed by
formulas (`EXP`, `SIN`) from two parameters you can change, with its line
chart, and a linear fit of measurements (`SLOPE`, `INTERCEPT`, `RSQ`,
`STDEV`) with its scatter chart.

The cells of the lab report are Python files in `src/templates/lab/<lang>/`;
after changing them, `just template-figures` (Python with numpy, matplotlib
and SymPy) runs them again and stores their output and figures.

## Template files

Template files made by LibreOffice, Word, Excel or PowerPoint (`.ott`,
`.ots`, `.otp`, `.dotx`, `.xltx`, `.potx`) open like any file, as a **new,
untitled document**: saving it never changes the template. To make one,
choose **Save as… › Save as template file (.ott)…** (or `.dotx`, `.ots`,
`.xltx`, `.otp`, `.potx`, depending on the document). Template files can be
shared and used in other office suites.

## Your own templates

In an open document, **Save as… › Save as template…** keeps a copy of it in
the browser under a name you choose. It then appears first in the gallery,
under **My templates**; **✕** deletes it. Saving again under the same name
replaces it.

These templates stay in this browser only (IndexedDB): they are not sent
anywhere, and clearing the browser's data deletes them. To share a template,
save the document as a file.

## Templates in your own repository or cloud

Keep your templates — letters with your letterhead, reports of your team,
exercise sheets — in a **Git repository** (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea / Forgejo)
or a **Nextcloud / WebDAV folder**, and add it to the gallery: **＋ Source…**
at the end of the tabs offers the repositories and servers you have used,
your cloud accounts (then the folder of the templates), or a repository by
its address (`https://github.com/team/templates/tree/main/letters`). The
source gets its own tab, read only when you choose it; every document in
its folder (and sub-folders) is a template — OpenDocument and Office files
and templates, Markdown, LaTeX, CSV, drawings and pictures.

A template picked there opens as a **new document**, not tied to the
repository or the server: save it where you want. A public repository needs
no account. A **private** one is read with a token of its site: when no
account of the site reaches it, adding it (or opening its tab later) asks
for a token allowed to read the repository, checks it, and remembers it in
this browser — or until the application is closed (see
[Git repositories](./git.md)). **✕ Remove the source**, under its templates,
takes it out of the gallery (its files are not touched). Shared with a team,
the same repository gives everyone the same templates, and Git keeps their
versions.

## Templates of a folder

When a [folder](./folders.md) is open, the documents of its `Templates`
folder (also `_templates` or `Modèles`, sub-folders included) appear first in
the gallery, under **Templates of** *the folder*. Choosing one opens a copy: a
new document, the template itself staying as it is.

In a folder you can write to, **Save as template…** asks where to keep the
template: in the folder's `Templates` folder (created if needed), shared with
everyone using the folder — a Git repository or a Nextcloud folder, for
instance — or in this browser.
