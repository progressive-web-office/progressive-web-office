Each requirement has an ID referenced from tests (`describe('REQ-xxx ...')`).

## 1. Vision

A simple, privacy-friendly office suite that runs **entirely in the browser**
as an installable Progressive Web App, written in TypeScript. It opens, edits
and saves word-processing documents (Word `.docx`, OpenDocument `.odt`, Markdown `.md`
and MDZ packages — zipped Markdown with embedded assets),
spreadsheets (Excel `.xlsx`, OpenDocument `.ods`, `.csv`), presentations
(PowerPoint `.pptx`, OpenDocument `.odp`) and displays PDF files. No document ever leaves the device.

## 2. Platform & architecture (PLT)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| PLT-001 | M | 0.0.1 | The system shall be implemented in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. |
| PLT-002 | M | 0.0.1 | The system shall process all documents client-side and shall not send document content to any server, except to a destination the user explicitly configured and invoked (git hosting, AI assistant, QRShare hand-off). |
| PLT-003 | M | 0.0.1 | The system shall be installable as a Progressive Web App (web app manifest + service worker). |
| PLT-004 | M | 0.0.1 | While the device is offline, the system shall start and provide all features of previously loaded versions. |
| PLT-005 | S | 0.0.6 | When a new version of the application is available, the system shall inform the user and offer to reload. |
| PLT-006 | S | 0.0.6 | Where the browser supports the File Handling API, the system shall register as a handler for supported file types and open launched files. |
| PLT-007 | M | 0.0.1 | The system shall work in the latest two versions of Chromium-based browsers, Firefox and Safari. |
| PLT-008 | S | 0.0.1 | The system shall apply a Content-Security-Policy that forbids inline scripts and remote script sources. |

## 3. File management (FILE)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| FILE-001 | M | 0.0.1 | When the user selects "Open", the system shall let the user pick a local file of a supported type. |
| FILE-002 | M | 0.0.1 | When the user drops a file onto the application window, the system shall open it. |
| FILE-003 | M | 0.0.1 | The system shall detect the document format from the file content (magic bytes / package mimetype), falling back to the file extension. |
| FILE-004 | M | 0.0.1 | If the user opens a file of an unsupported or corrupt format, then the system shall display an explanatory error message and keep the current state unchanged. |
| FILE-005 | M | 0.0.2 | When the user selects "Save", the system shall serialise the document in its original format and deliver it to the user (File System Access API where available, download otherwise). |
| FILE-006 | S | 0.0.2 | When the user selects "Save as" with a target format, the system shall convert the document to that format (docx ↔ odt ↔ md ↔ mdz, xlsx ↔ ods ↔ csv, pptx ↔ odp; PDF is saved as PDF). |
| FILE-007 | M | 0.0.2 | When the user selects "New document", "New spreadsheet" or "New presentation", the system shall create an empty document of that kind. |
| FILE-008 | S | 0.0.6 | The system shall keep a list of recently opened files in browser storage (IndexedDB) and let the user reopen them. |
| FILE-009 | S | 0.0.6 | When the user removes a recent file entry, the system shall delete its stored content. |
| FILE-010 | S | 0.0.2 | While a document has unsaved modifications, the system shall show a modified indicator and warn before the page is closed. |
| FILE-011 | C | 0.0.6 | The system shall autosave a draft of the open document to browser storage every 30 seconds while it has unsaved modifications. |
| FILE-012 | M | 0.0.1 | If a file larger than 200 MB (a ZIP archive: 1 GB) is opened, then the system shall refuse it with an explanatory message. |
| FILE-016 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall prefer open standards: new documents, spreadsheets and presentations shall be created in OpenDocument formats (`.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`) by default, and the open format shall be offered first when saving; the user shall be able to choose Microsoft Office formats instead, and the choice shall persist. Opening and saving every supported format shall remain available. |
| FOLDER-001 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user opens a local folder, the system shall list its documents by sub-folder in a side panel, open the one the user selects and, where the File System Access API is available, save it back into the folder (read-only elsewhere); the folder shall be offered again on the start screen, with a way to forget it; *Save as* shall write a new file chosen by the user, outside the folder. |
| FOLDER-002 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall search a word in all the text documents of the open folder (Markdown, LaTeX, text, BibTeX, Word, OpenDocument), ignoring case and accents, list the documents with extracts, and open a result at its first match. |
| FILE-017 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user shows a document read-only, the system shall show it with a visible read-only banner, refuse edits and in-place saving, and offer to edit a copy; documents from read-only sources (read-only folder, shared link) shall open read-only. |
| FILE-018 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall offer a gallery of templates and examples (letter, report, meeting minutes, exercise sheet, budget, grade book, invoice, talk, an example document showing the word processor's features, a lab report whose Python cells open with their output and figures already drawn, and a workbook of measurements with charts), in the interface language (English content for languages without a translation); a document created from a template shall be a new, untitled document in the preferred format.; the gallery shall show one kind at a time behind tabs (progressive disclosure) with a search through all of them, and offer drawings and schematics (electrical circuit, ladder diagram, Grafcet, pneumatic circuit, flowchart) and free pictures made by the application (graph paper, colour wheel, pixel-art canvas). |
| FILE-019 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user save the open document as a template kept in the browser (IndexedDB), list these templates first in the gallery, start a new document from one, and delete them. |
| FILE-020 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall open the template formats `.ott`, `.ots`, `.otp`, `.dotx`, `.xltx` and `.potx` as new, untitled documents not tied to the template's location (folder, server), and shall save the open document as a template file of its kind, with the template media type (ODF `mimetype` and manifest, OOXML main part content type). |
| FILE-021 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user opens a ZIP archive that is not a document (OpenDocument, Office Open XML, MDZ, a single LaTeX project, a ZIP of Markdown notes), the system shall show it as a folder in the side panel, decompressing each file only when it is opened (archives up to 1 GB, files up to 200 MB), leaving out junk entries and paths leaving the archive, show archives inside the archive as folders (up to 8 levels), keep changes made in it (including in nested archives) in memory, let the user download the archive with its changes and ask before closing a changed archive; files the system cannot show shall be offered for download. |
| FILE-022 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall open text and source files (plain text, C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, R, MATLAB, SQL and other languages, recognised by extension or name) in a code editor with line numbers, syntax colouring for the language, folding, search and go to line, read UTF-8 or else Windows-1252, save them under their own name in UTF-8 keeping their byte order mark and line ends, and print them with line numbers. |
| FILE-023 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall show pictures (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, AVIF, ICO, SVG without running scripts) fitted to the window or at their own size, with their dimensions. |
| FILE-024 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user comment a line of a source file (toolbar or Ctrl+Alt+M): the comment shall be written above the line as a comment of the file's language (`// REVIEW(Author): text`, block syntax where the language has no line comments), with the author asked once; such lines shall be highlighted and listed in a panel to go to or delete them. |
| FILE-025 | S | 0.2.0 | When a document is saved (file, folder, WebDAV, Git), the system shall keep a copy in the browser (IndexedDB), skipping a copy identical to the previous one and keeping the last 30 per document location; it shall list them, keep the current state as a named version, open a version in place of the content (the document keeping its location), download it or delete it. |
| FILE-026 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user clicks the name of the open file, the system shall let them type a new name, the extension being shown apart and kept (not doubled when typed again; names files cannot have refused); Enter or leaving the field renames, Escape cancels. A file of the open folder or archive shall be renamed there (refused when the folder is read-only or the name is taken, the panel and links following it); another file keeps the new name for its next save, in the recent files too; the versions of the file follow it; files of a repository, Grist or a server keep their name. |
| FILE-027 | M | 0.1.0 | When the user drops several files or a folder on the application, the system shall open them in the folder panel (a dropped folder as itself, writable where the browser allows it; several entries as one read-only folder) and show the first document; a single file shall open as before. |
| FILE-028 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall remember the network places used — repositories (opened, committed to), WebDAV / Nextcloud folders (opened, saved to) — and list them on the start screen to open them again in one click (a repository for reading even without its account); each place can be forgotten, all at once too, and remembering can be turned off in the settings (which forgets them). |
| FILE-029 | S | 0.2.0 | A document opened from or saved to a network place (repository, WebDAV / Nextcloud) shall keep its origin — in its metadata (`Source`, as an address) for text documents and presentations, and with its recent-file entry for every kind — so that, opened again from the recent files or from a copy on disk, **Save** writes it back to the same place (after the usual commit dialog, conflicts still detected); the origin is shown and can be detached from the document; keeping origins can be turned off in the settings. |
| FILE-030 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user add their own repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea / Forgejo, a folder of one) and cloud folders (Nextcloud / WebDAV) as sources of templates: each source has its tab in the gallery, read when chosen, every document of its folder being a template opened as a new document; a private repository not reached by an account of its site asks for a token to read it; sources are remembered and can be removed. |
| FILE-031 | S | 0.2.0 | A document saved in or opened from the browser's storage shall appear in the recent files and reopen from that storage as it is now; the start screen shall open the browser's storage as a folder. |
| FILE-032 | S | 0.2.0 | A command "Go to file" (Ctrl+Shift+O, and in the command palette) shall list the documents kept in the browser's storage and those of the folder open, the most recently changed first, each with its folders (their first and last ones always shown), and open the one found by typing part of its name or its path. |
| FOLDER-004 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall provide a file explorer built on a storage-independent `StorageProvider` interface (list, read, write, mkdir, move, remove; capabilities write and persistent access) that depends on nothing else in the application, with providers for local folders and the browser's private storage (OPFS), and shall let the user create, rename, move (drag and drop) and delete files and folders, the open document following a rename or a move. |
| FOLDER-006 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user opens a folder, the system shall let them choose a folder of the device, the browser's private storage (OPFS, kept across visits and shared with the other apps of the same origin) or a Nextcloud / WebDAV account, and the explorer shall create, rename, move and delete files and folders there too. |
| FOLDER-007 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user opens a folder, the system shall also offer the branches of the GitHub and GitLab repositories of the user's accounts: the whole tree listed at once, each change made in the explorer or by saving a document being one commit (a folder move or a deletion included), a new folder holding an empty `.gitkeep`, and a file changed in the repository since it was read not being overwritten. |
| FOLDER-008 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall show the size and the date of last change of each file, sort the entries by name, date, size or type (folders first) and remember the order chosen; the folder search shall first list the files whose name contains the words searched. |
| FOLDER-009 | S | 0.1.0 | In the file explorer, the arrow keys shall move between entries, Right and Left open and close folders (or go into a folder and back to its parent), Home and End go to the first and last entry, and Enter open a document. |
| FOLDER-010 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user drops files or folders of the device onto the file explorer, or chooses them with its import button, the system shall copy them into the target folder, giving a free name to those whose name is taken. |
| FOLDER-011 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall let the user select several entries (Ctrl+click, Shift+click, Ctrl+A, Shift+arrows) to delete or move them together, and shall offer to undo the last deletion (up to 64 MB). |
| FOLDER-012 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall copy, cut and paste files and folders (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V and its menu), within the open folder, giving a free name to those whose name is taken, and duplicate them next to themselves. |
| FOLDER-013 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall offer the actions on the selected entries, or on the folder for empty space, in a context menu opened by a right click, the Menu key or Shift+F10, usable with the keyboard (arrows, Escape). |
| FOLDER-014 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall download the selected file as it is, and folders or several entries as a ZIP archive, and copy their paths. |
| FOLDER-015 | S | 0.1.0 | The start screen shall offer to reopen the last five folders of the device opened, most recent first, each of which can be forgotten without touching the folder. |
| FOLDER-016 | S | 0.1.0 | The file explorer shall collapse all its folders, and open the folders leading to the open document to show it, on request. |
| FOLDER-017 | S | 0.1.0 | The folder panel shall list the tags of the folder's Markdown notes (`tags` and `keywords` of their front matter, and `#tags` in their text outside code, links and headings), the most used first with their counts, list the notes of a tag when the user picks it or searches `#tag`, and rename a tag in every note. |
| FOLDER-018 | S | 0.1.0 | The folder panel shall draw the graph of the links between the folder's Markdown notes (wiki links and relative Markdown links), and open the note the user picks in it or in its list. |
| FOLDER-019 | S | 0.1.0 | Beside the open Markdown note, the folder panel shall list the notes related to it, sharing its tags or linked with it either way, the closest first, with the reason. |
| FOLDER-020 | S | 0.1.0 | While a folder is open, the template gallery shall offer the documents of its `Templates` folder (or `_templates`, `Modèles`), opened as new documents; when the folder can be written, *Save as template* shall offer to keep the template there. |
| FOLDER-021 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user types `[[` (or `#` and a letter) in a Markdown note of the open folder, the editor shall list the matching notes (or tags of the folder), and insert the chosen one as a wiki link (or tag) with Enter or Tab. |
| FOLDER-022 | S | 0.1.0 | While a Git repository is open as a folder, the folder panel shall let the user start a new branch from the open one, open another branch, and, on a branch other than the default one, open a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) to the default branch. |
| FOLDER-023 | C | 0.1.0 | The editor shall show the `#tags` of a Markdown note of the open folder as tags, and the folder panel shall let the user give each tag a colour, kept for the folder and used in the panel and the notes. |
| FOLDER-024 | C | 0.1.0 | The folder panel shall create notes named and marked (front matter `id`) with an identifier made of the date and time, and a wiki link made of 8 to 14 digits shall go to the note whose name starts with that identifier or whose front matter has it. |
| FOLDER-025 | M | 0.2.0 | The notes of an open folder shall be indexed once — names, aliases, tags, links and the words around each link, not their whole text — in steps that leave the page responsive, with the progress shown; afterwards only the notes changed (by size and date) shall be read again, and links shall be resolved by name without going through every note, so that a folder of thousands of notes opens and its notes show their backlinks and related notes without blocking the browser. |
| FOLDER-026 | S | 0.2.0 | The backlinks of the open note shall be shown at the bottom of its page or in the side panel, as the user sets, sorted by name or by the latest changed, with or without the words around each link, folded or not, the settings kept; on request, the notes writing its name or an alias without a link (unlinked mentions) shall be listed, and a mention made a link in one click. |
| FOLDER-027 | S | 0.2.0 | The note of a day shall be opened, or created when missing, from a month calendar of the folder showing the days that have their note, and from a "today's note" button; it shall be named after its date in a format the user sets (`YYYY-MM-DD` by default, a `/` making sub-folders), in a folder and from a template the user sets, the template's fields (title, date in a format, time) filled. |
| FOLDER-005 | S | 0.1.0 | When the open folder holds linked Markdown notes, the system shall read and keep the notes' YAML front matter, follow `[[note]]`, `[[note#heading]]` and `[[note|alias]]` links (by name, nearest first, then by alias), offer to create a missing note, show picture embeds `![[image.png]]` from the folder, list the backlinks of the open note, and update links when a note is renamed. |
| FOLDER-003 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user Ctrl+clicks a link to a file of the open folder in a text document, the system shall open that document; links to web pages shall open in a new tab. |

| DOC-027 | S | 0.1.0 | The text editor shall keep a bibliography of sources imported from BibTeX, insert citations of one or more sources with an optional page, numbered in citation order or by author and year, and a list of the cited references that follows the citations; sources and citations shall be kept in DOCX (Word sources, CITATION and BIBLIOGRAPHY fields), ODT (bibliography marks and index), LaTeX (\cite, BibTeX file) and Markdown (pandoc citations and references), and read back from these formats and from Zotero and Mendeley citations in Word files. |
| DOC-044 | S | 0.2.0 | The text editor shall offer switchable editing modes for a document: visual (WYSIWYG), source (the Markdown or LaTeX text, highlighted, with a live preview) and reading (no toolbar); the choice shall persist per document kind. |
| DOC-045 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user change again everything a template puts in a document: the share of a spring (in percent of the free space, or as a weight) and the height of a space (cm, mm, pt or percent of the page height, `\vspace{0.3\textheight}`), opened by a double click; what a field shows; the depth of a table of contents; the spacing of a paragraph from the context menu; any number format code of a cell; the background of a slide and the vertical alignment of a text box. |
| DOC-046 | M | 0.2.0 | The system shall keep the paper (size, orientation) and the four margins of a text document, read and written in OpenDocument (page layout), Word (section properties), LaTeX (`geometry`) and Markdown (Pandoc's `papersize` and `geometry`), set them in the page setup, show the page on screen with that width and those margins and a boundary at the end of each page's text, make a page break start the next page there, lay springs out and print with them. |
| DOC-047 | S | 0.2.0 | Where the screen is large enough, the system shall show graduated rulers around the page (centimetres, or inches in the United States, from the edge of the paper): the horizontal one with the margins greyed and draggable and the left and first-line indents of the current paragraph draggable or moved with the arrow keys, the vertical one with the top margin greyed and the end of each page's text marked; they can be hidden. |
| DOC-048 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall set text as TeX does where the browser allows it: paragraphs broken as a whole and balanced headings, hyphenation in the document's language (which can be turned off), kerning and ligatures, no widow or orphan line in print; and offer small capitals, kept as `\textsc` in LaTeX, Pandoc's `[…]{.smallcaps}` in Markdown and the small capitals of OpenDocument and Word. |
| DOC-049 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall set selected blocks of a text document in two to six columns, with the gap between them and an optional line between them, filled one after the other and balanced, with column breaks, changed again or removed from the context menu; kept as sections with columns in OpenDocument, continuous sections in Word, `multicols` in LaTeX and `::: {.columns}` fenced divs with `\columnbreak` in Markdown, on screen and in print; and offer a newspaper template. |
| DOC-050 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user clicks a field, the system shall let them change what it shows, the format of a date or a time (short, medium, long, full, ISO) and whether it is the current one or a fixed one, with a preview, turn it into text or delete it; the format and the fixed value shall be kept in Markdown (`{date:full=2025-12-24}`), OpenDocument and Office Open XML. |

`index.md` + `manifest.json` + `assets/{images,videos,audio,files}/`,
extension `.mdz`, MIME type `application/x-mdz`. This project implements it
as a compatible producer/consumer and contributes a JSON Schema for the
manifest (`schemas/mdz-manifest-1.schema.json`), to be proposed upstream.

| MD-016 | M | 0.0.2 | When such a ZIP contains exactly one Markdown file, the system shall use it as the entry document. |
| MD-017 | M | 0.0.2 | When such a ZIP contains several Markdown files, the system shall ask the user to choose the entry document, pre-selecting `index.md`, else `README.md`, else the first file in alphabetical order; if the user cancels, then the system shall not open the archive. |
| MD-015 | M | 0.0.2 | When an imported plain ZIP is saved, the system shall produce a conforming `.mdz` package (generated `manifest.json`, `index.md`, images moved to `assets/images/` with rewritten links). |

| CODE-015 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user asks for it (View menu, or from a cell), the system shall show the dependency graph of the code cells next to the document: one node per cell with its number, language and defined names, coloured by state (run, out of date, failed, failed through a cell it uses, not run), one link per dependency labelled with the names it carries; clicking a node shall go to its cell, the graph shall follow the changes and the runs, and the same information shall be given as a list. |
| CODE-016 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall host anywidget widgets (AFM: initialize and render, the model interface, abort signals, composition) shown by code cells: from Python through the bundled anywidget, ipywidgets, comm and psygnal packages (with the ipywidgets boxes, grid, layout, label and HTML), and from JavaScript cells (`widget`, `display`, `ui`, `importWidget`); each view shall run in an isolated frame without network; changes shall travel both ways, and a widget marked with `ui` shall re-run the cells using it when the user changes it; `pwo.install` shall install pure Python wheels from a URL, a `wheel.txt` list or the package index, and `importWidget` read a module, after the user allowed the site, kept for offline use; saving and printing shall keep a picture of each widget, used by print, exports and the reopened document. |
| CODE-017 | S | 0.1.0 | When a Python, JavaScript or TypeScript file is open in the code viewer, the system shall let the user run it, or its selected lines, in the code-cell sandbox, and show its output, errors and figures, with a way to stop it. |
| CODE-018 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user runs code in a language whose runtime is not part of the application (Lua, SQL, R, C/C++), the system shall ask before downloading the runtime from its CDN, check each file against a pinned SHA-256, keep it for offline use, and run the code in the code-cell sandbox. |
| CODE-019 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user runs a file of an open folder, the system shall copy the files of its project (the folder of the file, or the nearest folder above holding a project file such as `pwo.toml`) into the sandbox, so that the code can import its modules and read its data files, and shall run the entry point, arguments, compiler options and standard input named by `pwo.toml`. |
| CODE-007 | S | 0.1.0 | When a document is saved as DOCX, ODT or LaTeX, the system shall write each cell as its code followed by its last output (text and pictures). |
| CODE-008 | S | 0.1.0 | Where Python code imports packages that are not in the standard library (numpy, matplotlib…), the system shall download them from the Pyodide CDN on first use, verify them against the hashes of the bundled lock file, and cache them for offline use. |

## 9e. Device-to-device exchange with QRShare (SHARE)

[QRShare](https://github.com/s-celles/QRShare) (AGPL-3.0) transfers files
between devices through animated QR codes (air-gapped) or WebRTC. Integration
is done at application level (URLs and Web Share). Both projects are licensed
under the GNU AGPL-3.0 or later, so QRShare code may be reused if a native
integration is ever needed.

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| SHARE-001 | M | 0.0.12 | When the user chooses "Send to another device", the system shall hand the current file (saved in its format) to QRShare: through the Web Share API when available (QRShare is a share target), otherwise by downloading it and opening QRShare's send screen. |
| SHARE-002 | M | 0.0.12 | Where the document is text and small enough, the system shall open QRShare's `#/send?data=…&policy=…` route directly. |
| SHARE-003 | M | 0.0.12 | The system shall register as a Web Share Target for supported files, so that files received in QRShare (or any app) can be opened directly in Progressive Web Office. |
| SHARE-004 | M | 0.0.12 | The system shall let the user choose the transfer policy (air-gapped only, prefer air-gapped, any) and the QRShare URL. |
| SHARE-005 | S | 0.0.12 | When the user chooses "Receive from another device", the system shall open QRShare's scanner that recognises what it is shown: a static QR code (an invitation or document link), animated QR codes or CIMBAR codes. |
| SHARE-007 | S | 0.1.0 | When a document that is not small text is sent to another device, the system shall hand the file to QRShare in the browser (app handoff protocol v1, `postMessage`, posted only to the configured QRShare origin) without downloading it; if QRShare does not answer, then the system shall fall back to a download and QRShare's "Prepare a transfer" screen. |
| SHARE-008 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user receives from another device, the system shall give QRShare a return address so that a received file can be opened directly in Progressive Web Office, accepting files only from the configured QRShare origin. |
| SHARE-009 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall build a link that contains the open document itself (text documents as Markdown, other documents in their format, compressed and base64url-encoded in the URL fragment), let the user copy it, and warn when it is long enough to be cut by some apps. |
| SHARE-010 | S | 0.1.0 | When the application is opened with such a link, the system shall rebuild and open the document — the fragment is never sent to a server — remove the fragment from the address, and report a damaged link. |
| SHARE-006 | C | — | Native, embedded implementation of the QRShare frame protocol (licences are compatible: QRShare is BSD-3-Clause since 0.5.0, Progressive Web Office AGPL-3.0-or-later). |
| SHARE-011 | S | 0.1.0 | When the user gives the address of a document on a web server, the system shall check that it can be downloaded and make a link (with its QR code) that opens it read-only in the application, optionally pinned to that version by its SHA-256 fingerprint; when the linked file has changed, or cannot be read (CORS, HTTP error, over 200 MB), the system shall say so and not show it. |
| SHARE-012 | S | 0.1.0 | Where QRShare announces the handoff protocol v2 in its manifest (`versions` containing 2, `features` `mode` and `reply-opener`), the system shall be able to ask QRShare for a given send mode (e.g. animated QR codes, skipping the choice) and, when receiving, to get the received file back in its own window, from QRShare's origin only, after the user's click in QRShare. |
| SHARE-013 | M | 0.2.0 | Before opening a file handed over by another app (QRShare, the system share sheet), the system shall check that it is a file it opens and that its content is what its name says (a PDF named `.docx`, a program, an empty file are refused with an explanation, never offered for download); a file from QRShare shall be opened only after the user has seen where it comes from (the QRShare address), its name, size and format. |
| SHARE-014 | S | 0.2.0 | Where the user gives a password, the system shall encrypt the document and its name inside the link (AES-GCM with a PBKDF2-derived key, random salt and nonce), and when such a link is opened, ask the password until it opens the document or the user gives up, without revealing anything on a wrong password. |

## 9f. AI assistant and agent integration (AI)

| AI-003 | M | 0.0.13 | Every change made by the assistant shall be undoable and visible (the assistant reports each tool action). |
| AI-004 | M | 0.0.13 | The API key shall be stored only in this browser and only if the user chooses so; it shall never be sent anywhere but to the provider API. |
| AI-005 | S | 0.0.13 | The assistant shall be able to write LaTeX equations, spreadsheet formulas and slide content. |
| AI-006 | S | 0.0.13 | Where the browser exposes an agent tool API (WebMCP `navigator.modelContext`), the system shall register the same document tools so that external AI agents can drive the application, with user confirmation for modifications. |
| AI-007 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user choose the AI provider of the assistant — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Mistral AI, Albert (French State), a local Ollama server, or any server offering the OpenAI chat completions API — with its own key, model and (for local and custom servers) API address, kept per provider; local servers on `localhost` shall be reachable over HTTP. |
| AI-008 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall give every provider the same document tools, confirmations and undo, ask consent again when the provider, address or model changes, and start a new conversation when the provider changes. |
| AI-009 | C | — | Several assistants in one conversation (e.g. one model drafts, another reviews). |

## 9g. Grist (GRIST)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |

| GRIST-002 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user browse the team sites and documents of a Grist account and open a document as a workbook: one sheet per table, the column labels in the first row, the record ids in the first column, formula columns with their computed values and dates as dates. |
| GRIST-003 | M | 0.1.0 | When the user saves a workbook opened from Grist, the system shall send only the changes: changed cells of editable columns, new rows (without an id), and — after confirmation — deleted rows; it shall then reload the document so that new rows get their ids and formulas their values. |
| GRIST-004 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall not write formula columns, the id column, or columns of complex types (references, lists, attachments), which are shown as text. |
| GRIST-005 | M | 0.1.0 | If the Grist server cannot be reached or refuses a request, the system shall say whether the address/HTTPS/CORS setup or the API key is the likely cause, and link to the server setup guide. |
| GRIST-006 | C | — | Python code cells reading Grist tables; writing documents of the text editor to Grist. |

| DAV-001 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user add cloud accounts — a Nextcloud / ownCloud server address with user name and app password, or the full address of any WebDAV server — check them when added, store them only in this browser, and forget them. |
| DAV-002 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user browse the folders of a cloud account and open any supported file. |
| DAV-003 | M | 0.1.0 | When a document opened from the cloud is saved, the system shall write it back to the same file; the user shall also be able to save any open document to a chosen cloud folder and file name, the extension choosing the format. |
| DAV-004 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall never overwrite a file that changed on the server since it was read, nor an existing file when saving a new one (conditional requests with ETags); it shall offer to save a copy next to it (default) or to replace the file. |
| DAV-005 | M | 0.1.0 | If the server cannot be reached or refuses the credentials, the system shall say whether the address/HTTPS/CORS setup or the credentials are the likely cause, and link to the server setup guide. |
| DAV-006 | C | — | Nextcloud login flow (no app password to copy), sharing links, and a recent-files list per account. |

## 9i. Real-time collaboration (COLLAB)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| COLLAB-001 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let the user start a real-time session on an open text document or spreadsheet and invite others with a link carrying a random room name and secret; opening the link shall join the session. The document shall travel directly between browsers (WebRTC, end-to-end encrypted), public Nostr relays only introducing the browsers to each other, with no server storing the document. |
| COLLAB-002 | M | 0.1.0 | While in a session, the system shall share every edit with the other participants within a second; concurrent edits of different cells or paragraphs shall all be kept, and every participant shall converge to the same content. A participant who joins late or comes back online shall receive what they missed. |
| COLLAB-003 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall show who is in the session — each participant with a friendly compound name (e.g. "Swift Crimson Falcon") and a matching colour, which the user can change — and where each one is working (selected cell, current paragraph). |
| COLLAB-004 | M | 0.1.0 | The system shall let any participant save named versions, shared with everyone and kept with their author and date, and restore one for everyone as a new edit, after saving the current state as a version. |
| COLLAB-005 | M | 0.1.0 | Each participant shall keep the session's document and version history on their device (IndexedDB), so that reloading the page rejoins the session with them, even when nobody else is online. |
| COLLAB-006 | M | 0.1.0 | The collaboration protocol, history and presence shall come from the `@scelles/collab` package, shared with QRShare (no duplicated implementation). |
| COLLAB-008 | S | 0.1.0 | The system shall let several people edit a text document on devices of which at least one is fully offline, merging their changes character by character (CRDT) through passes of animated QR codes handed to QRShare (handoff protocol v2), or files of codes: one device shows its state vector, the other shows only the updates missing from it, which are validated on an isolated copy (schema, limits, properties) before being applied, after the user saw a summary and accepted; frames shall be versioned, size-limited, optionally compressed and signed (Ed25519) by trusted devices, and every import logged. A device without the document's history shall join the history of the other device instead of starting its own. |
| COLLAB-009 | S | 0.2.0 | The collaboration bar shall tell where the connection is — the relays cannot be reached, looking for the others, receiving the document, connected — and, after 20 seconds without anyone, what to check (the other page open, a network blocking direct connections, the same Wi-Fi, a TURN server, synchronisation without a network); the settings shall let the user set the relays and a TURN server; without settings, a list of well-known relays shall be used, all at once, the same on every device; relays that refuse the messages shall count as unreachable. |
| COLLAB-010 | S | 0.2.0 | Participants shall introduce themselves (application, protocol version, kind of document) when they meet; when another app, version or kind of document joins, the bar shall warn that its changes are not trusted. |
| COLLAB-011 | S | 0.2.0 | When no participant can be reached directly for 15 seconds (browsers that cannot connect to each other, such as on a company network and a mobile network), the system shall also carry the session through the Nostr relays: messages encrypted with the secret of the invitation (the relays seeing neither the room nor the content), cut into pieces small enough for them, posted as ephemeral events, each delivered once; the bar shall say that the connection goes through the relays and is slower. |
| COLLAB-007 | S | — | Collaboration on presentations, comments shared during a real-time session, suggested changes (track changes), and a character-level text merge with remote carets. |

## 9k. Review: comments (REV)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| REV-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user comment the selected text of a text document, or the word at the cursor (toolbar or Ctrl+Alt+M), signing comments with a name asked once (by default the collaboration name) and the date; it shall highlight commented text, list the threads beside the page in the order of their text, select a comment's text when its thread is clicked, mark the thread under the cursor, and let the user reply, resolve, reopen and delete a comment (delete being undoable); comments whose text was deleted shall not be saved. |
| REV-002 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall read and write Word comments: ranges (`commentRangeStart`, `commentRangeEnd`, `commentReference`), `comments.xml` (author, initials, date, paragraphs) and `commentsExtended.xml` (replies, resolved state). |
| REV-003 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall read and write OpenDocument annotations: `office:annotation` with `office:annotation-end` for ranges (a comment without end being put on the word before it), author, date and initials, LibreOffice's replies (`loext:parent-name`) and resolved state (`loext:resolved`). |
| REV-004 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall read and write comments in Markdown with CriticMarkup: the commented text as `{==text==}` followed by `{>>Author: comment<<}`, replies following their comment, a comment without highlighted text being put on the word before it. |
| REV-005 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user track changes in a text document: while on, typed text shall be recorded as an insertion and deleted text kept, struck out, as a deletion, each with its author (asked once) and date (deleting tracked inserted text removing it); changes shall be shown in the text and listed in a panel to be accepted or rejected one by one or all at once, and kept in DOCX (`w:ins`, `w:del`/`w:delText`), ODT (`text:tracked-changes`, changed regions) and Markdown (CriticMarkup `{++ ++}`, `{-- --}`); LaTeX exports shall accept them. |

## 9m. Reading and reviewing (REVIEW)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| REVIEW-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer a review mode for text documents (toolbar or Ctrl+Alt+R) that lays the document out as pages like a PDF file (page breaks starting new pages), with no change to the text but comments still possible, and the same page controls as the PDF viewer: page number, previous and next, zoom, whole page or width, 1 to 4 pages side by side, and a choice between scrolling the pages and showing one spread at a time without scrolling (also offered by the PDF viewer); the choices shall be remembered. |
| REVIEW-002 | S | 0.2.0 | While reading a PDF file or reviewing a text document, the system shall turn the pages with single keys outside the fields (k/n/Page Down/Space/→ next, j/p/Page Up/Shift+Space/← previous, g/Home first, G/End last) and offer shortcuts to zoom (+ −), fit the width (w) or the page (h, 0), set the pages side by side (1–4), switch the flow (s), comment (c), go to the next and previous comment (] [), find (/), go full screen (f) and list the shortcuts (?). |
| REVIEW-003 | S | 0.2.0 | Page by page, the mouse wheel shall turn the pages when the spread has nothing more to scroll. |
| REVIEW-004 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer a full screen without distractions (f, Esc to leave) showing only the pages, the review bar and the comments. |
| REVIEW-005 | S | 0.2.0 | The PDF viewer shall offer the same review mode button and shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+R): the highlight and note tools named in the toolbar, the form and signature tools hidden, and the annotations panel shown, explaining how to annotate while it is empty. |
| REVIEW-006 | S | 0.2.0 | The review mode shall be one switch for every file: turned on in a text document or a PDF file, the files opened next open in review mode, until it is left in any of them; the settings shall show and change the same switch. |

## 9n. Settings (SET)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| SET-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer a settings window (⚙ in the header, and the command palette by "settings", "paramètres"…) with its settings grouped by category — general (language, theme, the user's name, the format family of new files), reading and review, writing (typography as you type), printing (paper, orientation, margins) — each kept in the browser as soon as it changes. |
| SET-002 | S | 0.2.0 | The reading and review settings shall set how PDF files and text documents in review mode open: pages side by side, fit to the width or to the whole page, scrolling or page by page, and whether the review mode is on (REVIEW-006); the choices made in the toolbar shall become the new defaults unless the user turns this off. |
| SET-003 | S | 0.2.0 | The user's name shall be one setting, asked once when it is needed and empty: it signs comments, PDF annotations and tracked changes, and shows the user in real-time collaboration and synchronisation without a network; renaming oneself in a collaboration shall change it, and a name changed anywhere (settings, the first comment) shall be shown at once to the other participants of a running collaboration, without leaving it; the name shall be asked in a window of the page, never in the browser's prompt that would freeze the page and its connections. |

## 9j. Images and drawing (IMG)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| IMG-001 | C | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer minimal photo editing of a picture (crop, quarter turns, mirror, resize, brightness and contrast, blur a region), keeping the original until applied and the change undoable. |
| IMG-004 | C | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user draw arrows, text and highlights on a picture, following its turns and mirroring. |
| IMG-002 | C | — | The system shall offer minimal vector drawing (shapes, lines and arrows, text, freehand), saved as SVG and editable again in documents and presentations — see DRAW-001..DRAW-011. |
| IMG-003 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user inserts or pastes a picture, the system shall offer to give it a caption (numbered as a figure) and an alternative text, and shall list the pictures without alternative text. |

## 9l. Teaching (TEACH)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| TEACH-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user mark paragraphs of a text document as solutions, shown framed and labelled, hide or show them on screen and in print, and save copies without them (the exercise sheet) in ODT, DOCX and Markdown; solutions shall be kept as Word content controls (tag `pwo:solution`, alias Solution), ODF sections named Solution*n*, and Markdown fenced divs (`::: solution`, `::: {.solution}`). |
| TEACH-002 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall generate N random variants of a text document: `{{X=rand(a..b[, step])}}`, `{{X=choice(…)}}` and `{{X=expression}}` define values drawn per variant with a seeded generator, `{{X}}` and `{{=expression[\|digits]}}` show values and computed results (arithmetic and common functions, no code run), numbers being formatted for the document's language; the result shall be a ZIP of the sheets (without solutions), their answer keys and a CSV of the values, in ODT, DOCX or Markdown. |
| TEACH-003 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall find the questions of a text document written with form fields (a list of answers starting with check boxes, ticked for the right ones; a text field holding the expected answer; a drop-down list set on the right choice), grouped by heading, and export them as Moodle XML, GIFT and an AMC (Auto Multiple Choice) LaTeX source. |
| TEACH-004 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall draw the Bode diagram (gain in dB, continuous phase in degrees, log frequency) and the Nyquist diagram of a transfer function written as a rational expression in s or p with named values, over decades chosen from its poles and zeros or by the user, work out the gain and phase margins, and insert the plots as described SVG pictures. |
| TEACH-005 | S | 0.2.0 | Where the exam mode is on (started with a teacher's code of at least 4 characters, kept hashed), the system shall reach no network but its own files (no AI, collaboration, synchronisation, repositories, servers or downloads), refuse pastes of what was not copied in the application and files dropped from outside, log with their time the window or full screen left, the pastes and connections refused and wrong codes, show a banner, and end only with the code, showing the log. |
| TEACH-006 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall draw the step response of a transfer function or of its closed loop with unity feedback (final value, overshoot, 10–90 % rise time, 5 % settling time) and its poles and zeros, and insert them as described SVG pictures. |

## 9o. Colour (COLOR)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| COLOR-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall let the user choose a colour (text and highlight of documents, text and fill of spreadsheet cells, fill and background of slides) from swatches, the colours used lately, or its hexadecimal, RGB or CMYK values, each updating the others; colours shall be kept in LaTeX with xcolor, whose `HTML`, `rgb`, `RGB`, `cmyk` and `gray` models and base colours are read. |
| COLOR-002 | S | 0.2.0 | When a colour is brighter than a coated paper offset press can print (approximately), the system shall warn and show how it would print, offering the printable colour; it shall warn when CMYK values exceed 300 % of ink; and a document shall be viewable with its colours as printed. |

## 9p. Backups (BACKUP)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| BACKUP-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall back up what the browser keeps — the files of its private storage and the recent files, drafts, templates and versions of its database — in one archive with a manifest, encrypted when the user gives a password (AES-GCM, key derived with PBKDF2), the password never kept by the browser. |
| BACKUP-002 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall write a backup, named by its date, as a download, to a folder chosen once, or to a WebDAV / Nextcloud account, and keep there the newest backup of each of the last 7 days and of each week for 8 weeks before, always keeping the newest and never touching other files. |
| BACKUP-003 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall restore a backup chosen as a file or where backups go, after its password, all of it or the files ticked, a file already present kept and the restored copy written next to it unless the user chooses to replace it; records already present shall be left untouched. |
| BACKUP-004 | S | 0.2.0 | The header shall always show how old the last backup is, marked when one is due; the user shall choose to be reminded every day, week or month, and the start screen shall remind when a backup is due and there is something to back up. |
| BACKUP-005 | S | 0.2.0 | The backup window shall explain that synchronisation is not a backup (a deletion reaches every device; a backup keeps the documents as they were) and the 3-2-1 rule. |
| BACKUP-006 | S | 0.2.0 | Where the user chose it, for a folder or a WebDAV target, the system shall make a backup by itself while the application is open whenever one is due (down to every hour), without asking, the password of an encrypted backup taken from the session only, and say it was made. |
| BACKUP-006 | M | 0.1.0 | When the application runs at its former address (`s-celles.github.io/progressive-web-office`), the start screen shall announce the new address (`progressive-web-office.github.io`) and offer to back up the documents, since browser storage is kept per site. |

## 9q. One's own devices (DEVSYNC)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| DEVSYNC-001 | S | 0.2.0 | Before synchronising, the system shall explain and have the user acknowledge that synchronisation is not a backup, that a document deleted on one device is deleted on every device (kept in a trash for 30 days), and that it is for one person's own devices, not collaboration. |
| DEVSYNC-002 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall pair the user's devices with a random key, devices finding each other through relays and exchanging everything end-to-end encrypted with that key; it shall list the paired devices, online or last seen, and make a new key unpairing the others, or stop synchronising a device, its documents kept. |
| DEVSYNC-003 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user asks, or by itself while the application is open when chosen, the system shall merge the documents of the browser's storage with each paired device online: copying documents new or changed on one, keeping a document changed on both twice (the newest under its name, the other as a conflict copy named alike on every device), and passing on deletions of documents unchanged since; hidden files and the trash are never synchronised. |
| DEVSYNC-004 | S | 0.2.0 | A document deleted, or replaced by another device's version, shall go to the device's trash, kept 30 days. |
| DEVSYNC-005 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall check every path received from another device and serve only the synchronised documents. |
| DEVSYNC-006 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user adds a device, the paired device shall show a one-time invitation (a QR code and a link to the application, valid 5 minutes, without the key); the new device opening it shall show verification emojis drawn from the invitation and its own ephemeral public key, and the paired device shall send the key, encrypted for that public key alone, only when the user accepts that device after comparing the emojis; the command palette shall offer to sync now, to show an invitation and to scan one. |
| DEVSYNC-007 | S | 0.2.0 | On a paired device, saving a document shall offer to keep it in the browser, synchronised (Browser storage › Documents, then open as the folder), or as a file; the window shall say that only the documents of the browser are synchronised, count them, open them, and copy recent documents among them. |
| DEVSYNC-008 | S | 0.2.0 | A new name given to a device shall be told at once to the paired devices online, and to the others when they next meet. |
| DEVSYNC-009 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall list the files of the synchronisation trash of this device by day, restore one where it was (next to it when the name is taken) so that the other devices get it again, and delete one for good after confirmation. |
| DEVSYNC-010 | S | 0.2.0 | When the user revokes one paired device, the system shall make a new pairing and give it to each other device online that accepts (after asking its user), encrypted for a fresh public key of that device (ECDH P-256, AES-GCM), never to the revoked device; stop the exchange with a device answered for twice; tell which devices got it; and forget the revoked device on all of them. |
| DEVSYNC-011 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall show the documents of this browser with, for each, whether it is the same on every paired device met, only here or different there, or on another device and not here yet (as of when each device was last met), the number of files in the trash, and a timestamped history of the synchronisations (device, documents received, trashed, conflicts, failures); a button of its own in the header shall open the synchronisation, marked while another device is online. |
| DEVSYNC-012 | S | 0.2.0 | The user's templates shall be synchronised with the documents, as files of the folder `Templates`: a template saved, changed or deleted on one paired device shall be so on the others after the next synchronisation. |
| DEVSYNC-013 | M | 0.2.0 | Devices that are not online together shall synchronise through the others: a device shall pass on to the devices it meets the devices it knows (the newest sighting of each, never itself nor a revoked device) and the documents, changes and deletions it got from others; each merge shall use what the two devices held after their own last merge, so that no change is lost and no deleted document comes back, whichever device starts; a deletion shall carry the content deleted, so that a device not met since drops only an unchanged copy, never a document changed or restored after the deletion. |

## 9r. Versions and history (VER)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| VER-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall compare two versions of a file: text files line by line, documents as their Markdown text, workbooks cell by cell; showing the lines added, removed and changed (word by word) with the unchanged ones folded, or the cells changed, and a count; it shall compare a version kept in the browser with the document as it is now. |
| VER-002 | S | 0.2.0 | For a document of a GitHub or GitLab repository, the system shall list the commits that changed it on its branch, newest first, with message, author and date, and compare each with the one before or with the document as it is now (unsaved changes included). |
| VER-003 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall open a version of the history in place of the document's content, the document staying where it is, and restore a version as a new commit, after a confirmation, the history kept as it is. |

## 9s. Physical quantities (UNIT)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| UNIT-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall know units — SI base and named units with their prefixes, common other units — combined by products, quotients and powers (`kN·m`, `km/h`, `m/s²`), with their dimension over the seven SI base quantities, and provide Excel's CONVERT (temperatures included). |
| UNIT-002 | S | 0.2.0 | A number typed with a unit (`12 mm`) shall be a quantity, kept as the number with the unit in its number format, so that XLSX, ODS and CSV files keep it and other spreadsheets show it; a formula giving a quantity shall be shown and saved in its unit; QTY and UNIT shall make a quantity and give its unit. |
| UNIT-003 | S | 0.2.0 | Formulas shall compute with quantities in SI and check their dimensions: addition, subtraction, comparisons and aggregates (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN) of one dimension only, products, quotients and powers combining them, functions of numbers on dimensionless values only — anything else being the error #UNIT!; the unit of a result is that of its first operand, combined units simplified (mm·m → mm², kg·m/s² → N). |
| UNIT-004 | S | 0.2.0 | The user shall show cells in another unit: quantities converted, plain numbers given the unit, formulas shown in it; cells of another dimension left as they were. |

## 9t. Drawing and schematics (DRAW)

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| DRAW-001 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer a vector drawing editor: rectangles (rounded or not), ellipses, polygons, lines and polylines with optional arrowheads, freehand strokes (smoothed), and text; each with its stroke colour, width and dash, fill colour and opacity; select, move, resize, rotate, duplicate, delete, group and ungroup, bring forward or back, align and distribute; with the mouse, the finger and the keyboard (arrows move by a grid step, Shift for a finer one); undo and redo; zoom and pan. |

| DRAW-007 | S | 0.2.0 | A drawing shall be inserted in a text document or a slide as a picture that stays editable (a double click opens the editor; saved back in place), kept as SVG with a PNG version where a format needs one (DOCX, PDF, LaTeX). |
| DRAW-008 | S | 0.2.0 | The system shall offer a bitmap painting editor, for a new picture or a picture of a document or a file (PNG, JPEG, WebP): pencil, brush, eraser, fill, line, rectangle, ellipse, text, colour picker, size and opacity of the tool, selection moved, copied or deleted, canvas resized, undo and redo, zoom. |

| DRAW-013 | S | 0.2.0 | The painting editor shall have layers — painted or vector, shown or hidden, with their opacity, added, duplicated, renamed, reordered, merged and deleted — and save a picture with layers as OpenRaster (.ora), reading it back, with a flattened PNG on demand. |
| DRAW-014 | S | 0.2.0 | On a vector layer, lines, rectangles, ellipses and texts shall stay shapes: picked, moved, restyled, their text changed, removed; kept in the OpenRaster file; made pixels on demand. |
| DRAW-015 | S | 0.2.0 | The painting editor shall import a picture as a new layer, set the background (a colour, transparent, a picture fitted as asked), crop to the selection, turn the picture a quarter turn or by any angle, flip it, turn a layer, keep the alpha channel in PNG, WebP and OpenRaster, and show transparency as a checkerboard. |

## 9u. Plugins (PLUG) — proposal

| ID | Pri | Phase | Requirement |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| PLUG-001 | C | — | The system should install content packs without code — templates, symbol libraries, snippets, palettes, themes, word lists, packages for code cells — described by a manifest. |
| PLUG-002 | C | — | The system should read a registry of plugins kept in a Git repository (`registry.json`: plugins, versions with the SHA-256 of their files, permissions, licence, revoked versions) and let the user browse, install, update and remove plugins in the settings. |
| PLUG-003 | C | — | A plugin should be installed at a pinned version, its files checked against their hashes, and kept for offline use; updates should be offered, never forced, with their changes and new permissions. |
| PLUG-004 | C | — | The user should add other registries — any Git repository or WebDAV folder — to share plugins privately. |
